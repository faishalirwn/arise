This is obviously for non native english speaker.

I wrote 'beside English' because I think English is just that important. Knowing English opens a whole new world of opportunities. As for other languages, it's subjective.

I think as long as you enjoy the content you're learning from, learning a language would be fun. For example, anime, k-drama, or history. This is crucial to make the learning process doesn't feel like a chore. In other word, why not learn the basics of the language while enjoying your favorite content and pick up the language along the way.

I recommend checking out [refold.la](https://refold.la/) if you want to learn more about structured method to learn language in a fun way. Forget about how school teaches you language. Refold is actually just an evolution or another version of [antimoon.com](http://www.antimoon.com/) and [www.alljapaneseallthetime.com](http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/).
