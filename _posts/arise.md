Arise. That's the name of this website project. I took it from Solo Leveling Sung Jin-Woo's catchphrase when he uses 'Shadow Extraction'. I think it sounds cool. Is this relevant? Absolutely (not).

This website was built because there was an event held by [Proclub](https://www.instagram.com/helloproclub) to make a personal/blog website.

Probably half of the time spent building this project was on design and overthink. There were just too many inspiration to learn from. At the end of the day, good enough is enough, nothing is perfect.

Anyway, I built this website using Next.js for the building block, Tailwind CSS for the styling, and Framer Motion for page transition. The blog posts are fetched and parsed from local markdown files. The website is hosted at [Vercel](http://vercel.app/).
